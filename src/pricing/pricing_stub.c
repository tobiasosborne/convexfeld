 * @file pricing_stub.c
 * @brief Stub implementations for pricing algorithm operations (M6.1.1)
 *
 * These stubs enable TDD by allowing tests to link and run.
 *
 * Implementations moved to dedicated files:
 * - PricingContext lifecycle (create/free/init): context.c (M6.1.2)
 * - cxf_pricing_candidates: candidates.c (M6.1.4)
 * - cxf_pricing_steepest: steepest.c (M6.1.5)
 * - cxf_pricing_update, cxf_pricing_invalidate: update.c (M6.1.6)
 * - cxf_pricing_step2: phase.c (M6.1.7)
 *
